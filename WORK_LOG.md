| Oct 25 | 11:25 - 11:55 |                                                                                                                               Began research into how hashmaps work in java, and how I could implement a similar system. |
| Nov 4  | 10:00 - 10:30 | Made a simple hashing function and an array (index being hashes) of ArrayLists (buckets). This system allows me to calculate imperfect hashes and still find the proper key, even if there are collisions in the hashes. |
| Nov 4  | 10:30 - 10:40 |                          Tested different prime numbers for the modulus value in the hash function and found that the largest 7-digit prime was faster than the largest 6 or 8-digit prime number, so I stuck with that. |
| Nov 4  |  13:00-13:15  |                                                                                                                                                  Cleaned up current system. Going to branch to implement linear probing. |
| Nov 4  |  13:15-13:45  |                                                                                Started working on the linear probing method. Still having issues with it finding items, and the products test is taking WAYYY TOOO LONG. |
| Nov 7  |  18:50-19:20  |                                                                                                       Got a partially working version. It is however, still very slow and needs to be improved to pass all of the tests. |
| Nov 7  |  19:20-19:50  |                                                 Reworked almost everything! Literally duplicated file, rewrote everything, and deleted the original. It's a lot faster now, but not fast enough for the full UPC list :( |
