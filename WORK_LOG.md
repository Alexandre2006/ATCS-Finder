| Nov 4  | 10:00 - 10:30 | Made a simple hashing function and an array (index being hashes) of ArrayLists (buckets). This system allows me to calculate imperfect hashes and still find the proper key, even if there are collisions in the hashes. |
| Nov 4  | 10:30 - 10:40 |                          Tested different prime numbers for the modulus value in the hash function and found that the largest 7-digit prime was faster than the largest 6 or 8-digit prime number, so I stuck with that. |
