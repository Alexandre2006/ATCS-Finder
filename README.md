# Finder
#### A puzzle created by Zach Blick for Adventures in Algorithms at Menlo School in Atherton, CA

## Your goal
Complete the functions, `buildTable()` and `query()` to create a data structure that facilitates fast lookup times. 

The function headers are in the `Finder` java file. Write your code there.

A tester file has been provided for you. It utilizes junit tests.
To use this test file, run either the entire thing or individual tests (one at a time). Each test runs a different number of queries
against a different database. The shortest test is `testElements` and the
longest test is `testProducts`.
